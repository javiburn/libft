# libft

My own C library, replicating the functions included in the libc, and with some additional functions that are somehow related to it.


## ðŸš€ About Me
I am learning how to write code at 42 Madrid, and this has been my first project of the Course using the C language, hence some functions might not be writter in the most efficient way.
